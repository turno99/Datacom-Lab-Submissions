The given program can encode a bitstream to voltage levels or decode a signal to a bitstream according to Manchester, Differential Manchester and AMI schemes.

## Bitstreams should be input as 11011101010010010....

## For signals:
### In the biphase schemes, the input should be as +5V,-5V -5V,+5V..... i.e. two halves of a single signal element split by a comma and two consecutive signal elements separated by a space.
### For AMI, the input should be as 0V, +5V, 0V, -5V, +5V.... i.e. two consecutive signal elements separated by a comma and a space.

Input and outputs are taken from input.txt and output.txt files respectively.
