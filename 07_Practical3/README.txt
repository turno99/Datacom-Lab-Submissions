The program is designed to encode bitstreams or decode voltage levels according to 2B1Q and MLT-3 schemes and B8ZS and HDB3 scrambling.

##For bitstreams, enter input as 01110101011110001... i.e. continuous string of bits.

##For voltage levels, enter input as +5V 0V +5V 0V 0V -5V... i.e. by separating two conssecutive signal elements with a single space.

Enter inputs into .txt files named according to the desired scheme.
